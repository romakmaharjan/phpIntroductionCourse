### PHP Conditional Statements
- Very often when we write code, we want to perform different actions for different conditions. we can use conditional statements in our code to do this.

- In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

1. if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
2. if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
3. if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
4. switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed
